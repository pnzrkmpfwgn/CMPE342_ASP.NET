As you can see there are a lot of project types where you can use ASP.NET in different forms. However we need this one. Notice the little tags underneath the 
headings of the projects. It has to be C#. Otherwise you might have to code your project with VB or other stuff that can be utilized to use ASP.NET.

After clicking 'Next' you will be greeted with this window. Make sure the Web Forms checkbox is checked on the right side.

After project creation you will see your project 'boilerplate' or 'template'. In this course you will use web forms in .aspx format.

Note: Forms, buttons, labels etc.. might look like HTML however avoid using HTML tag by manually typing into the source file. Because ASP.NET uses its own native
sugar coding for that and they are kinda hard to memorize unlike simpler html.
